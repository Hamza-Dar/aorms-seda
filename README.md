Android Based Restaurant Management System

An Android based Restaurant Order Management System (AROMS) that allows customers of the restaurants to place order using the restaurant provided tablets. This system will reduce the need of interaction between the customers and the waiters in the restaurant at the time of placing and modifying an order. 

The project consists of the following high level modules which each have their own functional decompositions. The modules interact and depend on each other as well.

1.  Order Placement Module
2.  Kitchen Management Module
3.  Hall Management Module
4.  Specialized Order Module
5.  Admin and Inventory Management
6.  Reporting Module

The base XML descriptions and guidelines willbe updated and added soon.
